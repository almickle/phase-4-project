* Navigate the website via the search bar
* Select articles based on categories
* Sort articles by date and popularity

 #### Stretch Goals 
* Paywall will generate after a visitor has viewed 3 pages (store cookies and authenticate visitors/users)
* Authorization: authorized users can access all posts on Den Boiz Times
* Page layout: toggle between a list and grid style view.


#### Styling
* Implementing Tailwind
* Black and white color scheme
* Categories will be displayed as widgets.
* Able to switch layout between list and grid (stretch deliverable, TBD)
